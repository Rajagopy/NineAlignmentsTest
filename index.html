      <h1 class="contentHead">What are Nine Alignments</h1>

      <p class="content">
        Nine Alignments come from the popular game of Dungeons and Dragons. This
        is generally used to help personalize a character to play as in the
        game. Nine distinct alignments define all the possible combinations of
        the lawful-chaotic axis with the good-evil axis. Each alignment
        description below depicts a typical character of that alignment.
        Remember that individuals vary from this norm, and that a given
        character may act more or less in accord with his or her alignment from
        day to day.

      <h1 class="contentHead">Good-Evil axis</h1>

      <p class="content">
        Good-Evil axis as the name suggests is the representative of innate good
        or evil in a person. The three stages in the Good-Evil axis are
        Good-Neutral-Evil. It's common for every human being to have feelings or
        episodes pertaining to evil or partially leaning towards the evil side
        of the spectrum every now and then. This is more exaggerated in
        fictional characters. <br />

        <strong> Good characters</strong> makes sacrifices to protect innocent
        lives and they have concern and respect for sentient beings. Qualities
        like Altruism, Kindness, Selflessness are attributed to "Good"
        characters. <br />

        <strong> Evil characters</strong> are deceptive, cunning and
        self-serving. They would lie, cheat and take lives without any qualms.
        They do the things that they do for selfish purposes or for no reason at
        all, simply because they can. <br />

        <strong> Neutral characters</strong> can be on the fence about decisions
        related to good or evil. They may have the desire or need to take lives
        but lack the resolve to do so. Their decision maybe purely personally
        driven and are usually varying on a case by case basis. <br />

      <h1 class="contentHead">Lawful-Chaotic axis</h1>

      <p class="content">
        Lawful-Chaotic axis represents the sense of justice or element of mayhem
        and disorder inside a person. The three stages in the Lawful-Chaotic
        axis are Lawful-Neutral-Chaotic. This concept is more relatable to
        everyone than the good-evil axis. Requiring well set laws or operating
        on pure chaos is a commonly observed diversity in humans. Orientation
        towards being Lawful or Chaotic is often habitude rather than choice.
        <br />

        <strong> Lawful characters</strong> are trustworthy, they keep their
        word, respect authority and traditions and judge incompetence and
        irresponsibility harshly.Lawful could also entail being narrow minded
        and restricted to traditions or laws. It could mean a lack of change and
        adaptability and also a little to no freedom.<br />

        <strong> Chaotic characters</strong> are all about freedom and
        flexibility. This freedom often comes along with recklessness,
        irresponsibility and sometimes dishonour. They also tend to resent
        authority. Their ideals promote the concept of freedom allowing people
        to think and act freely on an individual level rather than abiding by
        law. <br />

        <strong> Neutral characters</strong> are not black and white when it
        comes to obeying the law. They respect the law but don't feel the strong
        need to obey or disobey. They can act according to their needs. Some
        neutral characters may see this lack of affinity towards one side as
        superiority because either side has their own drawbacks. <br />

      <h1 class="contentHead">How does this quiz work</h1>

      <p class="content">
        This quiz is a fun little thought process of inserting onself into the
        world of fiction and testing what character troupe or perosnality type
        among the nine alignments would one fit in. Every question has 5 options
        to choose from based on how agreeable or diagreeable the statement in
        the question is. Try not to answer many questions with neutral so as to
        achieve accurate results.
