        <p class= "content">Nine Alignments come from the popular game of Dungeons and Dragons.
        This is generally used to help personalize a character to play as in the game. 
        Nine distinct alignments define all the possible combinations of the lawful-chaotic axis with the good-evil axis.
        Each alignment description below depicts a typical character of that alignment. 
        Remember that individuals vary from this norm, and that a given character may act more or less in accord with his or her alignment from day to day. </p>
